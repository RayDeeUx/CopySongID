# CopySongID Changelog
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub).
- Changes from [Copy Song ID](mod:johnny_cena.copy_song_id), including those that weren't mentioned in the original changelogs by the original developer:
  - Reposition the "Copy" button to avoid overlaps *again*. (Hopefully for the last time.)
  - Added SFX ID support. (Compact SFX cells are ignored. This will not change anytime soon.)
  - Added support to copy *all* Song or SFX IDs that a level uses. Open the level's Assets Browser!
  - Re-created the button texture so button colors are consistent across all contexts, including the Assets Browser.
