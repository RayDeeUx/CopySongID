# CopySongID
Copies the song/SFX ID for any given song/SFX cell.

Could also copy multiple song IDs or multiple SFX IDs if need be.

It's that simple, really.

For levels with multiple songs or SFX assets, press ![that blue "i" button](frame:GJ_infoIcon_001.png?scale=0.35) to open the Assets Browser for the level!
